BigBlueButton
=============
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  We believe that every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton. 

BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of slides (PDF and any document readable by OpenOffice), webcams, whiteboard, chat, voice over IP (using FreeSWITCH), and desktop. It can record and playback all content shared in a session.  The BigBlueButton project is is supported by a [community of developers] (http://www.bigbluebutton.org/support/) that care about good design and a streamlined user experience. 

The use cases for BigBlueButton are
  * One-to-one on-line tutoring
  * Small group collaboration 
  * On-line classes (25 or less)

BigBlueButton is built on the [shoulders of giants] (http://www.bigbluebutton.org/components/).

Getting Started
===============
All the core information is at the [Google Code project page] (http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/).  Here are a few quick links

If you want to see how BigBlueButton works, check out these two videos
  * [presenter] (http://www.bigbluebutton.org/videos/)
  * [viewer] (http://www.bigbluebutton.org/videos/)

After watching the videos, if you want to immediately try out BigBlueButton, the project maintains a live [demo server] (http://demo.bigbluebutton.org) that anyone can join.  

To quickly get started running your own BigBlueButton server
  * [Install on Ubunt 10.04 64-bit] (http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallationUbuntu)
  * [Download the BigBlueButton 0.81 Virtual Machine] (http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM)
